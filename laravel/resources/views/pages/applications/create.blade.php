    <h2>Basic Information</h2>
    <p>
        First things first, we need to get some basic information about your application.
        Once you've filled this out, you'll be asked to answer more in-depth questions.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is your opportunity to tell us about your project in general terms.
        What is the big picture?
        What is your inspiration for creating this?
        What do you want to accomplish and why?
        We have WAY more requests for money than we have money to give out.
        Help us understand what sets your project apart from the other applications we receive, and show us you have put thought into what challenges you may encounter.
    </p>
